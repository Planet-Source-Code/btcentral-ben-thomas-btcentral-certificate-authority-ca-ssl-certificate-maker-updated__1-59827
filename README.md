### Description

NEW VERSION - Now the Email certificate option works properly and there are also some slight bug fixes and the GUI has been slightly modified too! Descripton: This program is a GUI for openSSL, it lets you set-up your own CA and is totally free, it does all the hardwork - creates the configuration files, sends the commands etc. all you have to do is fill in a few fields... it's never been easier to set-up your own CA or make SSL/Email/Software Signing certificates! Make sure you download openSSL from: http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html and copy openSSL.exe and any of it's required DLL files to the folder CA.exe is in before use!
