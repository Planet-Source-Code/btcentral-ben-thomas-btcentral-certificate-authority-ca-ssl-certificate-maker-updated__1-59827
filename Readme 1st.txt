You must download openSSL before you run this program! It is just a GUI for openSSL!
you can obtain openSSL from: http://www.shininglightproductons.com/openssl/

You must then copy openSSL.exe and any of it's required DLL files to the folder
in which CA.exe is stored so the commands can be sent correctly.

Do not delete the newcerts or private folder and also do not delete index.txt,
index.txt.attr or serial.txt
(or the previous files with a .old extension otherwise the application will not work)
